Welcome to my about page! On this platform, you will discover a collection of content that I have found intriguing and valuable enough to share with the world. My name is Jeet Majumdar and I am a research scholar at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I have a passion for STEM and I am excited to share my experiences with you.

My fascination with science and technology has been a lifelong passion, and I have committed myself to using this interest to discover solutions for real-world problems. My career path has led me to become a computational material science researcher, and along the way, I have acquired a plethora of valuable knowledge and skills that are applicable in today's society.

During my leisure time, I enjoy socializing and involving myself in various extracurricular activities. I strongly believe in preserving a harmonious equilibrium between work and personal life, and these activities allow me to rejuvenate and recharge. Additionally, I have a liking towards reading classic literature, painting, and singing or listening to music. I also enjoy travelling, but I have yet to acquire many opportunities.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and thank you for visiting my website! If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am always happy to hear from my readers and would be more than happy to assist you in any way possible.

The best way to reach me is by email. You can send me a message in my [mail](mailto:mail2majumdar@gmail). I check my email frequently and will do my best to respond as soon as possible.
