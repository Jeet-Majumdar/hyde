MS Excel is a very powerful tool which can simplify the process of data analysis and data representation within a single framework. This post is intended to give an elementary level understanding on the basic features of MS-Excel. 

**Cell referencing**

A single file of excel is like a workbook with many *sheets* . Each sheet is divided into grids which can be identified by column-id (alphabet) and row-id(number). Example: `A22`, `G4`, etc. 

*Note: First column, then row.* 

A cell in an excel file can be referenced from any sheet within the file as follows:

`'<sheet_name>'!<cell_id>` : example,   'sheet_1'!G4

If one is referencing the cell within the same sheet then the <sheet_name>  may not be provided.

Similarly, a continuous cell block can be referenced by specifying the cell-id of the top-left corner cell of the block and the bottom-right corner cell of the block, separated by a colon *(:)*. Example: `B3:C7`

So far we have used variable referencing which means that, if we simply copy paste the formula somewhere else, excel will study the pattern where it is placed and it will change the input data to the formula. 
To use absolute referencing, place a *$* before the row-id and column-id of the cells. Example, `$A$1`.  Now wherever we copy our formula, this cell referencing will be fixed.

We can even use mixed referencing where we permit excel to change only one of the two, either row or column. Example,  `$A1`, `C$5`.

`F4` is a useful shortcut to toggle between the type of cell referencing keeping the cell selected.



**Cell Formatting**

- Cell type can be many, string, number, float, date, time, etc.
- There are plenty of options from colouring or highlighting the cells to orienting the cell text along a direction and more.
- You can use `format painter` to copy the format of a cell and apply the same format over another cell

- You can use a cell as a column header and use it to filter the column data
