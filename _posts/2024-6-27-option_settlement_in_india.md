Expiry and Physical Settlement in Indian Options Market

Options contracts grant investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) an underlying asset (stock or index) at a predetermined price (strike price) by a specific expiry date. This article explores option settlement in India, emphasizing the differences between stock options and index options.


## Understanding Expiry

- Every option contract has a defined expiry date.
- Options can expire in-the-money (ITM), out-of-the-money (OTM), or at-the-money (ATM).
- Expiry determines the option's value and settlement process.

## Settlement Methods

**Cash Settlement (Common):** This is the prevalent method for index options in India. Upon expiry, the difference between the strike price and the settlement price (the index level at expiry) is settled in cash.
If a call option is ITM (strike price lower than settlement price), the buyer receives the cash difference.
Conversely, if a put option is ITM (strike price higher than settlement price), the buyer profits from the cash settlement.
The option writer incurs the opposite cash flow depending on whether the option expires ITM or OTM.
**Physical Settlement (Less Common):** This method can be used for stock options. Upon expiry, the option writer delivers the underlying stock (for call options) or takes delivery of the stock (for put options) if the option expires ITM.


## Stock Options vs. Index Options: Settlement Differences

The crucial distinction lies in the underlying asset:

**Index Options:** Always settled in cash. The settlement price is derived from a specific index calculation methodology defined by the exchange (e.g., Nifty 50 expiry price is based on the average price of the constituent stocks during the expiry session).
Stock Options: Can be settled in either cash or physical delivery, depending on the option contract specifications and exchange rules. Cash settlement is becoming increasingly common for stock options as well, but physical settlement may still be an option for certain contracts.
Additional Considerations

**Margin Requirements:** Option trading typically involves margin requirements, which is a portion of the contract value that needs to be deposited upfront with the broker. These margins can vary depending on the option type (index or stock), strike price, expiry date, and market volatility.
Early Exercise: Although options have a specific expiry date, the buyer has the right to exercise the option early (before expiry) if it becomes profitable to do so. The settlement process in such cases would follow the same principles as expiry settlement (cash settlement for index options and cash or physical delivery for stock options, depending on the contract terms).

**Risk of cash settlement in Stock Option:** Some brokers have policies regarding automatic exercise of options near expiry if sufficient margins are not maintained close to expiry. This is because, in European Stock Option, if a trader do not close his/her position manually when a stock goes ITM on the date of expiry *(exactly on this day only: i.e last Thursday of month)*,  the option will be physically settled. This stock option requires delivery charges (tax + leverage). This charges has to be covered by the market partipant. Therefore, in order to ensure it, the brokers charge extra margin (even for option buyers) which grows as one continues to hold on till expiry. After expiry, this money will be later released if unused.
