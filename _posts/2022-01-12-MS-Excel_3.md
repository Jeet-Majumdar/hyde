**WorkbookEvents and WorksheetEvents**



*SheetActivate*

used for triggering something once the worksheet is activated.

```vb
Private Sub Workbook_SheetActivate(ByVal Sh As Object)
 MsgBox ("Hey you just selected " & ActiveSheet.Name)
End Sub
```

*BeforePrint*

Used to perform some action whenever the print button is clicked.

```vb
Private Sub Workbook_BeforePrint(Cancel As Boolean)
 
 Dim PrtResponse As Integer
 PrtResponse = MsgBox("This is a warning message before printing!", vbOKCancel, "Everything alright?")
 If PrtResponse = vbCancel Then Cancel = True
 
End Sub
```

*SheetChange*

Used to perform some action whenever there is any modification in the sheet.

```vb
Private Sub Workbook_SheetActivate(ByVal Sh As Object)
	'Display message box stating which sheet was just activated
	MsgBox ("You just selected " & ActiveSheet.Name)
End Sub
```

*SaveCopyAs*

Used to save a copy of the current workbook

```vb
ThisWorkbook.SaveCopyAs Filename:=</folder_path/save_filename>
```

Workbook *BeforeClose*

Used to do perform some task or display something before the Workbook closes



If you have a user form, and want to show it:

```vb
<userform_name>.Show
```

Hide a sheet:

```vb
<shee_name>.Visible = xlSheetVeryHidden
```

To run a module function that you have created from another code block of a different entity (Example: Code window of an UserForm)

```vb
Run "<Module_Function_name>"
```

Example:

```vb
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()
	Run "UserLog"
End Sub
```



Get number of worksheet, and select a random worksheet:

```vb
x = Worksheets.Count

Sheets(Application.WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(1, x)).Select
```



To check whether two group of cells intersect:

```vb
 'This code goes in the "ThisWorksheet" Object
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)

    'Original code from the MS Website:
    'https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff835030.aspx
    'Set isect = Application.Intersect(Range("rg1"), Range("rg2"))
    'If isect Is Nothing Then
    '     MsgBox "Ranges do not intersect"
    'Else
    '    isect.Select
    'End If
    
    'Iteration 1
    'Set isect = Application.Intersect(Target, Range(Range("A3"), Range("A3").End(xlDown)))
    'If isect Is Nothing Then
    '     MsgBox "Ranges do not intersect"
    'Else
    '     MsgBox "Ranges DO intersect"
    'End If
    
    'Iteration 2
    Set isect = Application.Intersect(Target, Range(Range("A3"), Range("A3").End(xlDown)))
    If isect Is Nothing Then
        End
    Else
         MsgBox "Hey, don't change this to " & Target.Value
         Application.EnableEvents = False
         Application.Undo
         Application.EnableEvents = True
    End If
 
End Sub
```



To protect a sheet with a password:

```vb
Private Sub Worksheet_Activate()

Dim UserPassWord As String

    'Take the user somewhere else
    ShGuide.Select
    
    'Input box to get password
    UserPassWord = InputBox("This sheet is highly classified." & vbNewLine & _
                            "You must be very important to view the contents." & vbNewLine & _
                             "Please enter password below", "Top Secret!")
    
    'Logical test to see if the password was correct
    If UserPassWord = "Password" Then
        'Turn OFF the "Events" to enable selection without triggering the code again!
        Application.EnableEvents = False
        'Select the top secret sheet
        ShTopSecret.Select
        'Ensure "Events are turned back on
        Application.EnableEvents = True
    Else
        'Display message box if password was incorrect
        MsgBox "You'd better RUN. Security have been notified!", vbCritical, "Access Denied!"
        End
    End If

End Sub
```



**User-defined Functions**

Example1:

```vb
'User Defined Functions (UDF's) always begin with the word "Function"

Function Pie_multiple(MyValue As Variant)

    Pie_multiple = MyValue * 3.14159

End Function
```

Example2:

```vb
Function Square(MyValue As Variant)

    Square = MyValue * MyValue
    
End Function
```

Example3:

```vb
Function WhereIsThisFile_residing()

    WhereIsThisFile_residing = ThisWorkbook.Path

End Function
```

Example4: Countdown Timer

```vb
Function BDayCountdown(MyValue As Variant)

    'Set up the variable
    Dim CountDay As Variant
    Dim CountHour As Variant
    Dim CountMinute As Variant
    Dim CountSecond As Variant
    
    'Forces a recalc on F9 (or Calc now)
    Application.Volatile
    
    'Calculate the individual elements
    CountDay = Int(MyValue - Now()) & " days, "
    CountHour = Hour(MyValue - Now()) & " hours, "
    CountMinute = Minute(MyValue - Now()) & " minutes, "
    CountSecond = Second(MyValue - Now()) & " seconds!"
    
    'Build the string and assign it to "BDayCountDown"
    BDayCountdown = CountDay & CountHour & CountMinute & CountSecond
    
    'Alternative method
    'BDayCountdown = Int(MyValue - Now()) & " days, " & _
                    Hour(MyValue - Now()) & " hours, " & _
                    Minute(MyValue - Now()) & " minutes, and " & _
                    Second(MyValue - Now()) & " seconds!"

End Function
```



To call a user-defined function from a different Workbook:

```vb
='<Workbook_name_where_the function_resides.xlsm>'!<function_name>(<parameter>)

='User_defined_function.xlsm'!Pie_multiple(10)
```



To create a folder:

```vb
MkDir "<folder_path>\<folder_name>"
```



To send email using Outlook:

```vb
Private Sub SimpleSendMailOriginalCode()
'This is the original code, which is slightly modified above
'This code uses "Late Binding". This means the code
'can be used from any PC.


Dim OutlookApp As Object        'Declare Outlook as an object
Dim OutgoingEmail As Object     'Declare the email as an object
Dim MyBodyText As String        'Holds the message itself

    'Create an object for Outlook
    Set OutlookApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
    'Create an object for the email
    Set OutgoingEmail = OutlookApp.CreateItem(0)

    'Build the text for the body of the message (could be read from ranges in Excel)
    MyBodyText = "Hi there" & vbNewLine & vbNewLine & _
                    "This is line 1" & vbNewLine & _
                    "This is line 2" & vbNewLine & _
                    "This is line 3" & vbNewLine & _
                    "This is line 4"

    'Turns off error handling (stops the "someone is trying to send an email" message)
    On Error Resume Next
    
    With OutgoingEmail
        .To = "someone@somewhere.com"
        '.CC = ""
        '.BCC = ""
        .Subject = "This is the Subject line"
        .Body = MyBodyText
        '.Attachments.Add ("C:Users\Alan\Desktop\Book1.xlsx")
        .Send
    End With
    
    'Cancels the error trap above
    On Error GoTo 0
    
    'Destroy object variables
    '  (in the reverse order in which we declared them)
    Set OutgoingEmail = Nothing
    Set OutlookApp = Nothing

End Sub
```
