*Git is a version control system for software projects.* In this post I will list down some of the important commands of git and their usage.

- `git config` sets configuration variables. There are lot of variables. Please look it up in the documentation. 
   Example: `git config --global user.email "abcdef_email@example.com"`

- `git init` creates a new repository (repo).
- `git remote add origin git@github.com:username/new_repo` adds a github repo to your local project 


- Cloning a private repo when you have the credentials:
  `https://username:access_token@github.com/username/repo_name.git` 

- Now after you have made some changes, you want to index those files into the staging area. The command to stage the modified files:
  `git add -A .ignore src/`

  > Git adds your modified files to the queue to be committed later. Files are not committed. Git add adds files to the Git index, which is a staging area for objects prepared to be committed. Add tells git to start tracking a file.

- After the files are staged, we will commit the files to our local repo. This will create new log, SHA1 hash and all others. The command to do this,
  `git commit -a -m "Trial commit"`
  "Trial commit" is the commit messsage. Ig you want to add any special character into the commit message, put a "\" before the special character.

  You can combine both actions with `git commit -a`. Although I do NOT recommend using it.
