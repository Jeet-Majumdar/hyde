## Basic

*Git is a version control system for software projects.* In this post I will list down some of the important commands of git and their usage.

- `git config` sets configuration variables. There are lot of variables. Please look it up in the documentation. 
   Example: `git config --global user.email "abcdef_email@example.com"`

- `git init` creates a new repository (repo).
- `git remote add origin git@github.com:username/new_repo` adds a github repo to your local project 


- Cloning a private repo when you have the credentials:
  `https://username:access_token@github.com/username/repo_name.git` 

- Now after you have made some changes, you want to index those files into the staging area. The command to stage the modified files:
  `git add -A .ignore src/`

  > Git adds your modified files to the queue to be committed later. Files are not committed. Git add adds files to the Git index, which is a staging area for objects prepared to be committed. Add tells git to start tracking a file.

- After the files are staged, we will commit the files to our local repo. This will create new log, SHA1 hash and all others. The command to do this,
  `git commit -a -m "Trial commit"`
  "Trial commit" is the commit messsage. Ig you want to add any special character into the commit message, put a "\" before the special character.

  You can combine both actions with `git commit -a`. Although I do NOT recommend using it.

- `git push` will push your changes in the local repo to your remote repo.


## Branching

- `git branch <branchname>]` will create a new branch
- `git checkout <branchname>` will enter into a particular branch of the project. 
- `git branch -m <old branchname> <new branchname>` will rename a local branch 
- `git branch -d <branchname>` will delete a branch
- `git push origin --delete <branchname>` will delete a remote branch
- `git push origin <branchname>` will push a branch to your remote repository

## Merging

Git performs merging in two ways: *1st forward merge* and *3 way merge*.

When there is a linear path from feature to master branch, the master branch pointer just has to be translated down the straight path to the feature pointer. This kind of merging is called 1st forward merging. 1st forward merging do not create new auto-commits by git before merging.

In case the master and feature branch takes different path after a commit point in the past, Git looks at 3 different points when a merge command is executed. 
1) The tip of the feature branch, 2) The tip of the master branch, 3) The commit point from where the feature and master branch diverged. Based on this 3 points, git combines the changes by creating new commit called the Merge Commit, then merges the two branches.

- `git merge <branchname>` will merge a branch into the active branch 
- `git merge <source branchname> <target branchname>` will merge a branch into a target branch


## Sharing & Updating Projects

- `git push origin <branchname>` will push a branch to your remote repository 
- `git push -u origin <branchname>` will push changes to remote repository (and remember the branch) 
- `git push` will push changes to remote repository (remembered branch) 
- `git push origin --delete <branchname>` will delete a remote branch 
- `git pull` will update local repository to the newest commit 
- `git pull origin <branchname>` will pull changes from remote repository 
- `git remote add origin ssh://git@github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git` will add a remote repository 
- `git remote set-url origin ssh://git@github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git` will set a repository's origin branch to SSH 


## Logging

- `git log` will display all the logs git has made during its course of action.
 It has got few important options: `--oneline` which gives a one line summary of the logs, `--graph` will give a tree like view of the various actions, `--stat` will display the quantity of change, `-p` will tell which files got change and what changes were made on those files.
- `git shortlog` will diplay quantity of commits of a specific authors. Options are: `-n`, `-s`, `-e`
- `git log --author="abcd"` will list out all the commits made by author *abcd* in the particular branch.
- `git log --grep="sometext"` will grep out all the lines in the log file which has the instance of *sometext* in it.
- `git log --pretty=format:"Hey %cn is the commiter, with full SHA1 as: %H, short SHA1 as: %h, and on the commit date: %cd"` will output into specific format
- `git log --merge --oneline` will show all merge commits, wherease `git log --no-merges --oneline` will show ONLY actual commits made BY people and not commits that are generated by merge operation.
